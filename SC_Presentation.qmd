# Theoretical models of the social comparison field


## Core concepts of social comparison 

"[social comparison is] the process of thinking about information about one or more person in relation to the self" [@wood1996, pp. 520–521]

1.  type of standard
2.  comparison dimension
3.  comparison direction
    1.  upward
    2.  downward
    3.  lateral
4.  contrast vs assimilation


See Arigo et al. [-@arigo2020][^1].

[^1]: They use the term "identification", instead of "assimilation", and "target" instead of "standard".

## Festinger's Social Comparison Theory[^2] 

[^2]: Crusius et al. [-@crusius2022]

1.  *content* of comparison studied
    1.  opinion
    2.  abilities
2.  *motivational* core
    1.  drive to accurately evaluate one's opinions and abilities
3.  tendency to compare with *similar* others, or slightly better others (in the case of abilities)
    1. "similar" in what sense?
4.  ... (other hypotheses)

::: notes
The motivational core is related to Festinger's interest in uncertainty (cognitive dissonance theory). Researchers focused on comparison of ability and comparison at an individual level (no group level)
:::

## Selective Accessibility Model[^3] (SAM) 

1.  explanatory *objective*: prediction of assimilation and contrast
2.  selective accessibility mechanism
    1. *phases*
       1.  initial broad assessment of similarity
           1.  perceived dissimilarity $\rightarrow$ dissimilarity hypothesis is tested
           2.  perceived similarity $\rightarrow$ similarity hypothesis is tested
    2.  heightened cognitive accessibility
        1.  similarity hp $\rightarrow$ accessibility of standard-consistent self-knowledge $\rightarrow$ assimilation
        2.  dissimilarity hp $\rightarrow$ accessibility of standard-inconsistent self-knowledge $\rightarrow$ contrast

[^3]: Mussweiler [-@mussweiler2020]

## SAM

![Selective accessibility mechanism [@mussweiler2020]](img/SAM.png)

## SAM

### Predictions 1

1. *cognitive accessibility* $\rightarrow$ self-evaluation outcome
    1. manipulation of similarity (different task) $\rightarrow$ assimilation
    2. manipulation of dissimilarity (different task) $\rightarrow$ contrast
2. self-evaluation outcome $\rightarrow$ *cognitive accessibility*
    1. manipulation of comparison target
        1. similar comparison target $\rightarrow$ focus on similarity (different task)
        2. dissimilar comparison target $\rightarrow$ focus on dissimilarity (different task)
        
## SAM
### Predictions 2

3. *consequences*
    1. motivational
    2. affective [@epstude2009]
    - e.g., assimilation with higher standard $\rightarrow$ > motivation and similar affect
4. concept of *similarity*
    1. self-evaluation: similarity on the critical dimension
    2. cognitive accessibility: similarity of anything
        1. e.g., social category, critical dimension, related dimension, etc.
5. efficiency of similarity testing

        
::: notes
Conditions that promotes similarity/dissimilarity

This finding suggests that under conditions that promote
similarity testing, the accessibility of standard-consistent target knowledge
is increased. Under conditions that promote dissimilarity testing, however,
standard-inconsistent knowledge becomes more accessible.

similarity on anything: even what induces the perception of similarity such as ambient warmth

## Attributional comparison models^[Main source: Suls and Wheeler [-@suls2020]]

<div style="height: 10px;"></div>

### Theoretical origin

Related attributes hypothesis [@goethals1977]

<div style="height: 10px;"></div>

### Proxy model [@wheeler1997; @martin2000]

1. how do people predict their performance?
    1. "can i do X?"
2. variables
    1. maximum effort exertion 
    2. similarity on related attributes
    - also: perceived similarity of tasks
    
## Attributional comparison models

### Triadic model [@suls2000three]
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
1. types of *opinions*
    1. value 
    2. belief 
    3. mixed-type
2. preference assessment: "do I like X?"
    1. comparison with a person with similar values
3. belief assessment: "is X correct?"
    1. comparison with an expert
::: 
    
::: {.column}
4. preference prediction: "will I like X?"
    1. pattern of agreement or disagreement with the target
    2. reaction of a person to X
        1. assuming similarity on related attribute
5. mixed-type opinion
    1. comparison with a "similar expert"
:::

::: notes
"if we are correct then the cognitive machinery described in the proxy
and triadic models is activated in ambiguous situations to decide wisely and
avoid failures, social conflicts, and other adverse events."

## Dimensional Comparison Theory^[Main source: [@helm2020dimensional]]

<div style="height: 10px;"></div>

### Origin

DCT is a theoretical extension of the Internal/External Frame of Reference Model (I/E model) [@marsh1986verbal].

<div style="height: 10px;"></div>

### What is "dimensional comparison"?

Dimensional comparison, like social and temporal comparison, consists in *evaluating* a target by comparing it with a reference standard [@moller2016generalized].

Specifically, in dimensional comparison both the target and the standard are *attributes* of the person making the comparison [@moller2001dimensional].

::: notes

The
model describes the path-analytic finding that students’ subject-specific
self-concepts are far less correlated than are their achievements in verbal
and mathematical areas; at the same time, achievement has positive effects
on self-concept in the same area and achievement has negative effects on
self-concept in the noncorresponding area

:::


## Dimensional Comparison Theory

### Core questions

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
1. what is the *motivation* behind dimensional comparison?
    1. self-evaluation (or self-differentiation)
    2. self-maintenance
    3. self-enhancement
    4. self-improvement
:::

::: {.column}
2. what *areas* are compared dimensionally?
    1. comparison between any personal attributes
    2. three variables
        1. common context
        2. similar metric
        3. perceived importance
        
:::

::::
    

3. what are the *effects* of dimensional comparison?
    1. contrast $\leftarrow$ belief of negative association
    2. assimilation $\leftarrow$ belief of positive association
    3. mood

## Dimensional Comparison Theory

### Generalized I/E Model [@moller2016generalized]

Subsequent extension of DCT  

Main *assumptions*:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

1. domain extension
    1. other subjects
    2. extra-academic domain
2. causal relation
    1. predictors extension: domain-characteristics
    2. criteria extension: domain-specific beliefs and learning behaviors

## Others

1. Downward Comparison Theory [@wills1981downward] $\rightarrow$ proven wrong [@gerber2018]
2. Construal Theory and Upward Social Comparisons [@collins1996better; @collins2000among] 
  1. Collins proposed the assimilation vs contrast effects
  2. It is similar to SAM
3. Self-Evaluation Maintenance model (SEM) [@tesser1988toward]
    1. which is different than social comparison [@wheeler2020history]
4. Social Comparison Orientation [@gibbons1999individual]
5. local vs general comparison [@zell2020better; @zell2020effects]
6. vertical vs horizontal comparison $\leftrightarrow$ agentic and communal motives [@locke2014agency]
7. Social Identity Theory and Self Categorization Theory
8. Temporal comparison [@wilson2020temporal]
9. ... 

::: notes
Construal:

"In this way, Collins’ model is mutually compatible with proxy. Mussweiler presents a similar model (the selective accessibility model), but it is based on cognitive accessibility, not on expectations (see Chapters 1 and 2)."

horizontal comparison:

"An extensive corpus of research suggests that perceived similarities (connective
comparisons) enhance and perceived dissimilarities (contrastive
comparisons) undermine warm, positive, empathic, communal feelings toward
others (Byrne, 1971; Locke, 2003; Montoya, Horton, & Kirchner, 2008)."

# Experimental designs

These designs are taken from Gerber [-@gerber2018] meta-analysis.

## Reaction method

### Type 1

1.  between subject design
2.  task: gambling task (e.g., roulette)
3.  conditions: 3X3
    1.  roulette scenarios
        1.  the participant gains X amount of money
        2.  the participant loses X amount of money
        3.  the participant doesn't lose any money (even)
    2.  comparison condition
        1.  comparison with a participant with a lower credit
        2.  comparison with a participant with a higher credit
        3.  comparison with a participant with the same credit
        4.  no comparison scenario (control condition)
      
## Reaction method

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

3.  dependent variables
    1.  self-esteem
    2.  mood
    4.  empathy toward the standard
    5.  play intention
    
:::

::: {.column}

### Type 2

1.  same structure as type 1.
2.  different task and dependent variables

:::

::::

### Type 1 vs Type 2

1. difference in self-evaluation
    1. The outcome of type 1 is based on luck $\rightarrow$ no self-evaluation.
    2. The outcome of type 2 is based on the ability of the participant $\rightarrow$ self-evaluation
